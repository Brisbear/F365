# imaging-antimicrobial-pharmacodynamics
Computational procedure for imaging based antimicrobial pharmacodynamic study

HK2
rnaseqHK2.r: identification of differentially expressed genes, PCA plot, upset plots.
generate.degs.cds.ann.r: generate dataframe of gene ensemble ID, entrenz ID, symbol, and name
plotCircosHK2.r: generate circus plot.
plotComplexHeatmapHK2.r: produce complexheatmap of selected genes.
extsignore.r: produce specfic signor gene regulatory network based on differentially expressed genes.
plotUpsetHK2.r generate upset plot to show uniquely/commonly differentially expressed genes across all conditions.
